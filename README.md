# The Pizza Race
Game Design Workshop | Spring 2023

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A two-person project done by Samuel Rocha and Darrell Weaver.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLAYER 1 CONTROLS = A & D to move Left and Right, Space to Jump

PLAYER 2 CONTROLS = Left Arrow and Right Arrow to move Left and Right, Keypad 4 to Jump

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Battle another player as cubes working for rival pizzeria chains, racing through an apocalypse-torn city as you attempt to deliver the pizza of higher quality.

The player has to avoid incoming debri while grabbing collectibles that increase the quality of your pizza, indicated by the health bar towards the bottom of each player's screen. Colliding with incoming obstacles lowers this bar. This bar also decreases over time. The first player whose quality reaches 0 loses.

The game is able to be restarted by hitting the Enter key upon a player's defeat, and (on the arcade version) you can quit to the arcade menu using the Escape button.
