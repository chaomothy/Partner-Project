# Funny Cube 2 : Pizza Race (WIP TITLE)
Game Design Workshop | Spring 2023

A two-person project done by Samuel Rocha and Darrell Weaver

Battle another player as cubes working for rival pizzeria chains, racing through an apocalypse-torn city 

as you attempt to deliver the pizza of higher quality.

PLAYER 1 CONTROLS \\ PLAYER 2 CONTROLS
Left & Right = A & D \\ Left Arrow & Right Arrow
Jump = Space \\ KeyPad 4


The player has to avoid incoming debri while grabbing collectibles that increase the quality of your pizza, indicated by the health bar towards the bottom
of each player's screen. Colliding with incoming obstacles lowers this bar. This bar also decreases over time. The first player whose quality reaches 0 loses.

The game is able to be restarted by hitting the Enter key upon a player's defeat, and (on the arcade version) you can quit to 
the arcade menu using the Escape button.
